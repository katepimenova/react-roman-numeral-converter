##The Problem

We need to create a "React" based application that will convert an integer into Roman Numerals.

## Demo

https://katepimenova.github.io/roman-numeral-converter/

## What is being used 

[React](https://github.com/facebook/react) , [Lodash](https://lodash.com/)

## Development server
Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
(it is required to run `npm install` before this command)

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests.

## Running syntax check

Run `npm run lint`.
